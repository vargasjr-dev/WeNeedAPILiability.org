# WeNeedAPILiability.org

An advocacy website promoting human accountability for autonomous systems. This project proposes that every automated action with real-world effects should be legally attributable to a specific human individual.

## About

As AI agents and autonomous systems increasingly act on our behalf, determining who is responsible when things go wrong has become genuinely difficult. Current legal frameworks were designed for a world where humans made decisions and machines executed them. That assumption no longer holds.

This website advocates for a simple principle: the chain of accountability should never break. For every action an AI system takes, there should be a human who stands behind it.
