# API Liability Act of 2026

Discussion Draft  
Version 0.1  
Last updated: February 1, 2026

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "API Liability Act of 2026".

## SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

The purposes of this Act are to:

1. Preserve a durable link between autonomous system behavior and human accountability.
2. Ensure that automated actions remain attributable to a clearly identified natural person.
3. Create economy wide incentives for safe, interpretable, and controllable system design.
4. Reduce systemic risk arising from the diffusion of responsibility in the development and deployment of autonomous systems.

## SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

### (a) Findings.

Congress finds the following:

1. Software systems increasingly initiate actions through application programming interfaces and similar mechanisms that may have financial, operational, informational, or physical effects.
2. Existing legal frameworks generally assume that a natural person makes a consequential decision and a machine executes it. That assumption is increasingly strained as software systems become more autonomous.
3. When accountability for consequential actions is unclear or diffuse, incentives for oversight, restraint, transparency, and control are weakened, increasing the likelihood of harm at scale.
4. Historically, society has reduced collective harm from powerful technologies by assigning clear responsibility to identifiable human actors, including in transportation, finance, medicine, critical infrastructure, and firearms.
5. It is in the public interest to ensure that autonomy in software does not become a mechanism for evading responsibility through organizational diffusion or technical design choices that undermine auditability.

### (b) Sense of Congress.

It is the sense of Congress that autonomous systems should remain meaningfully accountable to humans and that requiring attribution of consequential automated actions to responsible natural persons is a practical and technology neutral approach.

## SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

1. Automated System means any software, hardware, or combined system that executes actions based on computational processes, including machine learning, rule based automation, or other algorithmic methods.

2. Autonomous Operation means operation in which an Automated System initiates, selects, schedules, modifies, or executes actions without contemporaneous, action specific human instruction.

3. API Call means any machine initiated request, instruction, or invocation to an external interface, service, device, or system that may result in data access, state change, transaction execution, control signals, or other effects.

4. Covered Action means an action performed by or on behalf of an Automated System that has, or is reasonably likely to have, an External Effect.

5. External Effect means an effect outside of the executing system's internal computation, including:
   a. movement, transfer, commitment, or exposure of funds or assets;
   b. creation, modification, deletion, or disclosure of records concerning individuals or organizations;
   c. changes to production systems, critical infrastructure, safety relevant processes, or access controls;
   d. issuance of commands to physical devices or control systems;
   e. creation, dissemination, or targeting of communications to the public or to individuals at scale; or
   f. other materially consequential effects as determined by the Commission.

6. Covered Entity means any legal person or organization that develops, deploys, operates, offers, or makes available an Automated System in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce where such system performs Covered Actions.

7. Responsible Individual means a specific natural person designated to bear accountability obligations for Covered Actions performed by a Covered System.

8. Covered System means an Automated System that performs Covered Actions during Autonomous Operation.

9. Audit Trail means a secure and tamper evident record sufficient to determine, for each Covered Action:
   a. what action occurred;
   b. when it occurred;
   c. what system initiated it;
   d. the identity of the Responsible Individual;
   e. the identity of the Covered Entity;
   f. the inputs and authorizations used; and
   g. relevant system state or rationale artifacts as required by regulation.

10. Commission means the Federal Trade Commission.

## SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT TO DESIGNATE A RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUAL.

### (a) Designation Required.

A Covered Entity shall not permit a Covered System to perform any Covered Action unless a Responsible Individual has been designated for that system and action category.

### (b) Specificity and Non Delegability.

1. Each designation shall identify a Responsible Individual by legal name and reliable contact information.
2. Each Covered Action shall be attributable to exactly one Responsible Individual at the time the action occurs.
3. Designation of a role, committee, or generic rotation without identifying a specific individual on duty shall not satisfy this requirement.

### (c) Authority and Access.

A Responsible Individual must have sufficient authority and access to information to require safeguards, halt actions, or materially modify system behavior when necessary.

### (d) Prohibition on Evasive Design.

A Covered Entity shall not deploy a Covered System in a manner designed to impede attribution, degrade auditability, or prevent effective intervention.

## SEC. 6. LOGGING AND AUDITABILITY.

### (a) Audit Trail Requirement.

A Covered Entity shall maintain an Audit Trail for each Covered Action. Audit Trails shall be retained for not less than five years and made available to authorized regulators pursuant to lawful process.

### (b) Standards.

The Commission shall establish baseline technical standards for Audit Trails proportionate to risk, including requirements for integrity protection, time synchronization, and access control.

## SEC. 7. DUTIES OF THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUAL.

A Responsible Individual shall exercise reasonable oversight proportionate to the risk posed by the Covered Actions, including maintaining controls to prevent unauthorized actions, detect anomalous behavior, and disable or restrict the system when warranted.

## SEC. 8. LIABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT.

### (a) Attribution.

For purposes of Federal civil enforcement, Covered Actions shall be deemed attributable to both the Covered Entity and the designated Responsible Individual.

### (b) Standard.

The Commission may impose civil penalties where it establishes failure to designate a Responsible Individual, failure to maintain required auditability, reckless operation without adequate safeguards, or intentional evasion of accountability.

### (c) No Private Right of Action.

Nothing in this Act creates a new private right of action or limits remedies otherwise available under law.

## SEC. 9. SAFE HARBORS.

The Commission shall establish safe harbors for good faith compliance, including maintenance of adequate audit trails, documented controls, and reasonable intervention procedures. Safe harbors shall not apply where systems are intentionally designed to evade attribution or oversight.

## SEC. 10. RULEMAKING AND COORDINATION.

The Commission shall promulgate implementing regulations within eighteen months of enactment and shall coordinate with relevant sector regulators to align requirements and avoid duplication.

## SEC. 11. CIVIL PENALTIES.

Violations of this Act shall be treated as violations of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

## SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect twenty four months after the date of enactment, with authority for phased compliance based on risk.
